Made my first website after learning HTML, CSS, and bootsrap.

At this time i was working as a BDA for a company and they wanted me too learn about SEO and marketing stuff.

So as i was already doing a web-development course so i thought why not make one and try the key word thing on my own website.

That didnt go as planned but enjoyed making this.
